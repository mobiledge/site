  <p>Hi, I'm Rabin, a Senior iOS Developer based in Calgary with over 10 years of native iOS development experience. I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, from banking apps at Capital One to retail solutions at Loblaws, and agricultural technology at Telus Agriculture.</p>

  <h2>💡 My Development Process</h2>

  <h4>🤝 Let's Start with a Chat</h4>
  <p>First things first – I love to sit down and really understand what you're looking to build. No technical jargon, just a friendly conversation about your business goals and how an app can help achieve them. Think of it as brainstorming with a friend who happens to know a lot about apps!</p>

  <h4>📝 Planning Your App's Journey</h4>
  <p>Once we're aligned on the vision, I'll map out how we'll get there. I use modern architectures like MVVM and TCA, but don’t worry – this just means your app will be built on a solid foundation that scales as your business grows.</p>

  <h4>💪 Building with Care</h4>
  <p>This is where I roll up my sleeves and bring your app to life using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to testing and quality. Your app will work flawlessly, and I’ll keep you updated with regular demos and feedback.</p>

  <h4>🚀 Launch and Beyond</h4>
  <p>Getting your app on the App Store is just the beginning! I’ll take care of all the technical aspects and remain involved for ongoing updates and improvements. Consider me your long-term app partner, ready to help your digital presence grow.</p>
