  <h1 class="text-center">Our Development Process</h1>
  
  <p>We believe in keeping things simple and transparent. Here's how we'll work together to bring your app idea to life:</p>
  
  <h2>Start with a Coffee and a Chat</h2>
  <p>We kick things off by sitting down together (virtually or in-person) to really understand what makes your business tick. No technical jargon – just an honest conversation about your goals, your customers, and your vision for the app. This helps us map out a plan that aligns perfectly with your business needs.</p>
  
  <h2>Design That Delights</h2>
  <p>Next, our creative team gets to work crafting an app interface that your users will love. We create designs that not only look great but feel natural and intuitive to use. We'll share our progress with you every step of the way, making sure it captures your brand's personality perfectly.</p>
  
  <h2>Bringing Your App to Life</h2>
  <p>This is where the magic happens! Our development team uses the latest <strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>SwiftUI</strong> technology to build your app. We focus on creating something that's not just beautiful, but also fast, reliable, and future-proof. Regular check-ins with you ensure everything's progressing exactly as you envision.</p>
  
  <h2>Launch with Confidence</h2>
  <p>When it's time to launch, we're there to make sure everything goes smoothly. But that's not where our journey ends – we stick around to provide support, monitor performance, and help your app grow alongside your business. Think of us as your long-term tech partner, always ready to help when you need us.</p>
  
  <p>Throughout the entire process, we keep the lines of communication wide open. You'll always know exactly where we are in the development journey, and we're always just a message away if you have questions or ideas to share.</p>
