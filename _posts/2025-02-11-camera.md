## Real-World Examples That Work

Look at how some popular apps are already doing this right:

- **Warby Parker** lets customers virtually try on glasses right from their phone, helping them find the perfect pair without visiting a store
- **Venmo** speeds up payments by letting users scan QR codes to quickly connect with friends
- **Evernote** turns your phone into a document scanner, making it simple to digitize receipts and notes

## What You Can Build

Here are some practical ways to use camera features:

- Scan QR codes for instant payments or to access special deals
- Let users upload profile pictures or product photos for reviews
- Use AR to show how furniture would look in a room
- Verify IDs or documents without paperwork
- Create social sharing moments with filters and effects

## Why Your Users Will Thank You

Camera features do more than just look cool – they solve real problems. They can turn a 10-step process into a single tap, help users make better purchase decisions, and add a bit of fun to everyday tasks.

## Getting Started
